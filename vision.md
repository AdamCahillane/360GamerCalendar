# Project Vision
Our goal is to create a study planner for students with the design language of Xbox 360 consoles, which is now considered nostalgic. Beyond aesthetics, it can include friends lists, parties, mini-games and gamified actions as might be found on a console. Overall, the study planner must create a “vibe” that will make planning study more comfortable.
